## Overview of the analysis:
The analysis for this project was used to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal, to do this bike trip analysis was completed using the trip duration. The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week were all plotted.
